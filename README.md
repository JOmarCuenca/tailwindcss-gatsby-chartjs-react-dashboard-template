# Description

This project was created as a template to create dashboard like websites using static website rendering of GatsbyJS, the beauty of ChartJS and Tailwind CSS with a powerful framework such as ReactJS to make it useful.

This is still a barebones implementation, as there is no API. All of the current Charts were created using [Faker.js](https://github.com/faker-js/faker).

However the site seems to be dynamic enough to pull data from an API, such as Firebase, Mongo, SQL, etc.

# Quick Start

If you want to use this template, of course you are free to do so.

You can start your project either by ```git clone``` this project and making the modifications manually. (not really recommended, as the git logs will be cloned as well.)

To really have a fresh start, I recommend to do so using the following commands.

```bash
  $ yarn gatsby new <target directory> https://github.com/JOmarCuenca/tailwindcss-gatsby-chartjs-react-dashboard-template
  # or
  $ npx gatsby new <target directory> https://github.com/JOmarCuenca/tailwindcss-gatsby-chartjs-react-dashboard-template
```

    <h2>ReactJS</h2>

  Used as the main framework for building the components to be rendered.

    <h2>TailwindCSS</h2>

</div>

  Used as a substitute for vanilla css, which makes it more manageable during development and smaller for deployment.

  Static Website Generator for smaller packages for production and faster website rendering.

    <h2>ChartJS</h2>

  Just an amazing framework for creating beautiful charts for web.

    <h2>Typescript</h2>
  </a>
</div>

  Main programming language, as tis my opinion, Typescript is bastly superior to vanilla Javascript.

    <h2>Faker</h2>
  </a>
</div>

  Awesome package capable of generating fake (but Realistic) data. 
  
  Obviously during deployment this will become non-essential.

# Inspiration

As any good programmer I want to do as little work as possible. 

I leave this public for the whole community to see, in case someone finds it useful or needs some point of reference for other similar project.

Feel free to open issues if you want, I intend to mantain this repo.
